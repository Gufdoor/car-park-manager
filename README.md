# Car Park Manager

Car Park manager 'tis a Flutter project that provides to the user an easy way to manage 'tis car park. 

The user is able to set the amount of vacancies that 'tis car park has and change it whenever he wants to. Also, for every parking space the user can change a status of availability: vacant, occupied and unavailable.
These status can be set by selecting a parking space and configuring the check-in and check-out of a vehicle. Every parking space action gerenates a register, which the user can consult in a different screen to check and control the turn over of 'tis car park.

This project uses technologies such as Modular (navigation and modular injection), BLoC (state management) and unit and widget tests. Also, 'twas used modular architeture and concepts of SOLID and clean code.

Notes: 
- This project can be easily compiled for Android devices, but not sure for iOS ones since I don't have a MacBook to build it
- The main language in this app is Brazilian Portuguese 

Feel free to give any suggestion!
